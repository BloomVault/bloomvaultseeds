      A century of stigma and resilience — cannabis through the lens of history.

  </figure>

  <p>
    In November 2025, the world quietly marks a century since the first coordinated efforts to outlaw cannabis began.
    One hundred years of stigma, propaganda, and lost potential — but also one hundred years of persistence, passion,
    and resilience from growers, healers, and believers who never gave up on the plant.
  </p>

  <h3>From Medicine to Menace</h3>
  <p>
    Before prohibition took hold, cannabis appeared in American apothecaries as a common remedy for pain, nausea, and
    insomnia. That changed in the 1930s when political fear, misinformation, and racial bias turned a once-useful herb
    into a cultural menace. What had been a healing plant became a villain — and the legal consequences lasted generations.
  </p>

  <h3>The Long Shadow of Prohibition</h3>
  <p>
    By the mid-20th century, prohibition had spread worldwide; in the U.S., the 1970 Controlled Substances Act put
    cannabis in Schedule I. Communities — especially marginalized ones — paid the price. Yet underground growers
    responded with ingenuity, quietly preserving and refining genetics. Legendary lines like Skunk, Haze, and Northern
    Lights weren’t born in labs — they were crafted by dedication and necessity, protected in basements, barns, and
    hidden valleys.
  </p>

  <h3>The Rise of Legalization & Cultural Shift</h3>
  <p>
    In the 2000s, reform accelerated. Medical programs laid the groundwork; adult-use markets followed. What began as
    counterculture is now an agricultural, medical, and lifestyle industry. Still, stigmas linger — research barriers,
    uneven access, and outdated perceptions. Normalization takes time, and responsibility.
  </p>

  <h3>From the Ground Up: A New Era of Growing</h3>
  <p>
    For us at <strong>BloomVault Farms</strong> in Sutherlin, Virginia, this centennial isn’t just a historical marker —
    it’s a reminder of why we do what we do. Every seed we curate, every cross we make, and every grower we partner with
    is part of a legacy that survived a century of suppression. Today’s small-batch growers aren’t just chasing potency;
    they’re chasing purpose — reviving lost expressions, breeding with integrity, and growing with transparency.
  </p>

  <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
  <p>
    A hundred years after prohibition began, the soil is finally richer with understanding. Growers now have tools, data,
    and community support that didn’t exist even a decade ago. The next hundred years belong to those who grow with
    integrity — who document, test, and share honestly — and who keep the focus on the plant, the craft, and the people.
