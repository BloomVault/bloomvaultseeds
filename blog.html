    <h2>November 2025 — A Century in the Shadows: Cannabis, 100 Years Later</h2>

  <p>
    One hundred years ago, cannabis entered the shadows in America. With the 1920s Federal Bureau of Narcotics campaigns,
    misinformation and fear replaced centuries of medicinal and agricultural use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today — in 2025 — the plant is returning to the light. Legal markets are growing, hemp innovations are booming,
    and home cultivators are redefining what quality looks like. But the story isn't just policy. It's personal, cultural,
    and deeply rooted in community.
  </p>

  <h3>Prohibition’s Echo</h3>
  <p>
    Nearly a century of stigma forced growers underground — yet they never stopped evolving the plant.
    Skunk, Haze, Diesel, Cookies — these weren't corporate inventions. They were crafted in garages, basements,
    secluded barns, and hidden valleys by people who believed in cannabis when the world didn’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    That legacy shaped today’s genetics. It taught us resilience, creativity, and the value of plant-driven progress
    over profit-driven hype.

  <h3>The New Era — Opportunity & Responsibility</h3>
  <p>
    As legalization expands, we face a new challenge: honoring the roots of this culture while shaping its future.
    Craft breeders, home growers, and small seed companies must carry forward what made cannabis special:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Authenticity over mass production</li>
    <li>Plant-first breeding, not market-first</li>
    <li>Community-built knowledge and transparency</li>
    <li>Preservation of rare traits and old-world terps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cannabis isn’t just entering the mainstream — it’s reclaiming its identity.
  </p>

  <h3>Where BloomVault Stands</h3>
  <p>
    Here in Sutherlin, Virginia, we’re building from the roots up — honoring the growers who paved the path before us
    while crafting genetics built for the next century.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe in vault-worthy quality. Real breeding work. Real grow-tested selections. Real passion.
    Because even as the industry shifts, the plant — and the people who love it — deserve more than shortcuts.
  </p>

    A hundred years in the shadows — and cannabis still grows toward the light.

  <p>
    Here's to the next century. To growers. To preservation. To keeping cannabis — and its culture — in good hands.
