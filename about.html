  <h1 class="page-title">About BloomVault Farms</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>BloomVault Farms</strong>was built from the ground up in Sutherlin, Virginia — not by investors or corporations, but by growers with genuine passion for the plant and a drive to do things the right way. What started as a small local project has grown into a focused genetic vault dedicated to curating, breeding, and preserving premium THCA and CBD hemp genetics with integrity and care.
  </p>
    Every cultivar we release is the product of hands-on selection and countless hours of observation — chosen for vigor, consistency, and real-world performance. From old-school gas and skunk to the dessert and candy profiles shaping modern culture, our lineup reflects both tradition and innovation.
  <p>
    At BloomVault, our goal is simple: to bring growers genetics they can count on — reliable, compliant, and elite-quality seeds born from passion, patience, and purpose. We’re here to deliver nothing less than the best possible plants for those who share the same love for the craft.

    <h2>BloomVault Farms Grow Guide:From Seed to Vault</h2>
  </div>

  <article class="grow-content">
    <h3>🌱 Germination (Days 1–7)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Safely awaken your seed and establish a strong taproot.</p>
    <p>Soak seeds in clean, room-temperature water (65–75°F) for 12–24 hours, then transfer to moist paper towels or directly into your starter medium. Keep warm (75–80°F), dark, and humid (80–90%). Expect roots within 24–72 hours and transplant once the taproot reaches ½ inch. Ideal pH: <strong>6.0–6.5 (soil)</strong> or <strong>5.8–6.0 (hydro)</strong>.</p>

    <h3>🌿 Seedling Stage (Week 1–3)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build roots and early structure.</p>
    <p>Keep temps at 72–78°F and humidity at 65–75%. Use gentle LED light (18/6 cycle) about 24–30 inches above canopy. Feed lightly with an NPK ratio around <strong>2-1-2</strong> at ¼ strength once true leaves form. Avoid overwatering — seedlings thrive on light, warmth, and oxygen.</p>

    <h3>🌾 Vegetative Stage (Weeks 3–8)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Encourage rapid growth and strong branch formation.</p>
    <p>Maintain 75–85°F daytime temps, 55–65% humidity, and 18/6 lighting. Gradually raise nitrogen levels with an NPK of <strong>3-1-2</strong>. Supplement with Cal-Mag and silica for structure. Train plants through topping or LST for even canopies. Water thoroughly but avoid constant saturation.</p>

    <h3>🌸 Flowering Stage (Weeks 8–14)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximize resin, aroma, and yield.</p>
    <p>Switch lighting to <strong>12/12</strong>. Keep temps between 70–80°F (day) and 60–68°F (night). Reduce humidity gradually from 50% to 40%. Transition nutrients to bloom ratios: <strong>Early (2-2-2)</strong>, <strong>Mid (1-2-3)</strong>, <strong>Late (0-3-4)</strong>. Flush with pure water the last 7–10 days for cleaner flavor.</p>

    <h3>💨 Drying & Curing (2–4 Weeks)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Preserve terpenes and smoothness while preventing mold.</p>
    <p>Hang trimmed branches upside down in a dark, ventilated room at 60–65°F and 50–55% humidity for 7–14 days. Once stems snap, move buds into glass jars (70–80% full) and burp daily for 10 days, then weekly. Cure for 3–6 weeks minimum for smooth, aromatic flower.</p>

    <h3>🌰 Seed Harvest & Storage (For Breeders)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Preserve genetic integrity and long-term viability.</p>
    <p>Wait until calyxes swell and seeds darken with tiger stripes (4–6 weeks post-pollination). Dry for 2 weeks at 60°F and 40% humidity, then store in airtight containers with desiccant packs. Keep in a cool, dark place (40–50°F). Properly stored seeds remain viable for 5+ years.</p>

    <h3>💎 Pro Tips</h3>
    <ul style="line-height:1.7;color:#cfcfcf;">
      <li>Always check runoff EC and pH to prevent nutrient lockout.</li>
      <li>Increase airflow in flower to deter mold and enhance resin production.</li>
      <li>Keep detailed grow notes — phenotypes, feeding, and techniques — to refine future runs.</li>
      <li>Remember: less is more. BloomVault genetics thrive with consistency, not excess.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;color:#d3b062;font-weight:600;">
      From seed to cure, treat your plants with patience and precision — and they’ll reward you with vault-grade results.
