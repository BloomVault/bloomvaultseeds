  <h1 class="page-title">About BloomVault Farms</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>BloomVault Farms</strong>was built from the ground up in Sutherlin, Virginia — not by investors or corporations, but by growers with genuine passion for the plant and a drive to do things the right way. What started as a small local project has grown into a focused genetic vault dedicated to curating, breeding, and preserving premium THCA and CBD hemp genetics with integrity and care.
  </p>
    Every cultivar we release is the product of hands-on selection and countless hours of observation — chosen for vigor, consistency, and real-world performance. From old-school gas and skunk to the dessert and candy profiles shaping modern culture, our lineup reflects both tradition and innovation.
  <p>
    At BloomVault, our goal is simple: to bring growers genetics they can count on — reliable, compliant, and elite-quality seeds born from passion, patience, and purpose. We’re here to deliver nothing less than the best possible plants for those who share the same love for the craft.
